# Google Cloud Custom Agent Skills 🚀

A curated collection of production-grade, enterprise-ready **AI Agent Skills** designed for Google Cloud data engineering, analytics modeling, streaming pipelines, Lakehouse architectures, and cloud security.

These skills empower AI coding assistants (Google Antigravity, Gemini CLI, Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code) with deep domain knowledge, hardened execution scripts, and field-tested architectural blueprints.

> [!NOTE]
> **Complement to Data Agent Kit**: These skills complement the official [GoogleCloudPlatform/data-agent-kit](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/data-agent-kit) by focusing on specialized production workflows, migration frameworks, and advanced cross-service integrations.

## 🛠️ Installation & Usage

### 1. In Google Antigravity / Gemini CLI
Clone or copy this repository into your local agent configuration directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.gemini/config/skills
git clone https://github.com/ricardolui/gricardo-add-on-skills.git ~/.gemini/config/skills
```

### 2. Private Credentials Configuration
To configure local private credentials (such as Looker API keys or default project profiles) without ever committing them:

1. Copy the example environment template or create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
2. Populate your local `.env` variables:
   ```env
   LOOKER_BASE_URL="https://<YOUR_INSTANCE>.looker.app"
   LOOKER_CLIENT_ID="<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>"
   LOOKER_CLIENT_SECRET="<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>"
   ```
   *(Note: `.env` is permanently ignored by `.gitignore` and will never be tracked by Git).*
